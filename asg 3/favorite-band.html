	<h2>Why They're my Favorite</h2>

	<p>I would say Midland is favorite band because I feel like I can listen to them no matter what mood I'm in. I always seem to enjoy listening to the music, whether it's on the drive home, or through my airpods while I run. They have calming voices and pleasant sounds that always help me relax. Not only that, but I think they have a great sense of style! I especially love the outfits they wear on their album covers. They seem to bring another layer to country music, and it is very interesting.</p>
